# React-Redux Weather App

This app gets up-to-date and accurate weather forecast information available for the next five days. 

This app works for cities in India, if you want to change the place, just refer the weather_list.js carefully. Besides ROOT_URL, you can see the desired place.

This app has been developed to practice my skills with React, Redux and network requests. This project shows you how to:

1. Use axios to make aysncronous network calls.
2. Parse JSON data and generate model object from the data.
3. Use redux-promise middleware for handling promises.
4. Use the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather forecast for 5 days.
5. Use Sparklines to get the graphical output of the data.
6. Use lodash to get the average of the data.
